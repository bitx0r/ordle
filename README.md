**This is best played on a desktop browser.**\
It's more of an \*ordle game engine, with a 5 character word-based game as a demo.
Character set, number of games and word selection and validation can easily be overwritten in [main.js](main.js).

To play xOrdle, go here: https://bitx0r.github.io/ordle/

You can change the number of games at once by changing the url.

For example:

2x2 https://bitx0r.github.io/ordle/index.html?r=2&c=2 \
2x8 https://bitx0r.github.io/ordle/index.html?r=8&c=2

Not well tested beyond 3x3.
